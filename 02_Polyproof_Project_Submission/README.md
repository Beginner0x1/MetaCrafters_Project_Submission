## Introduction to ZKSnarks Circuit

This provides an overview of a custom zero-knowledge circuit implemented using the Circom language. The circuit, named `Multiplier2`, demonstrates the creation of logic gates and their connections to create a custom computation. The resulting circuit can be used to generate zero-knowledge proofs for certain computations while keeping the input values private.

## Explanation of Zksnark Circuit through Diagram 

The circuit involves the following logical gates and logical Operations:

The circuit operates with two input signals, A and B, serving as operands for the computation. It utilizes three distinct logic gates—AND, NOT, and OR—each defined as individual templates. Two intermediate signals, X and Y, are generated as outputs from the AND and NOT gates, respectively. The final output signal, Q, is computed using the OR gate, with inputs derived from the intermediate signals.

**Code**

```solidity
pragma circom 2.0.0;

/*This circuit template checks that c is the multiplication of a and b.*/  

template Multiplier2 () {  

   // Declaration of signals.  
   signal input a;  
   signal input b;

template AND() {
    signal input a;
    signal input b;
    signal output out;

    out <== a*b;
}

template NOT() {
    signal input in;
    signal output out;

    out <== 1 + in - 2*in;
}

template OR() {
    signal input a;
    signal input b;
    signal output out;

    out <== a + b - a*b;
}

component main = Multiplier2();
```
Circom code defines a circuit template named Multiplier2 with the primary goal of verifying whether the output signal c corresponds to the result of multiplying two input signals, a and b. The circuit is structured around logic gates, specifically AND, NOT, and OR gates, each encapsulated within their respective templates. In the initial section of the code, input and intermediate signals are declared. Signals a and b serve as the input operands for the multiplication, while x and y are designated as intermediate signals. The output of the multiplication operation, denoted as c, is also declared.

The subsequent section introduces three components, namely andGate, notGate, and orGate, corresponding to the AND, NOT, and OR logic gates, respectively. These components are crucial for implementing the logic necessary to verify the multiplication relationship.

The subsequent code segment establishes the connections between the signals and logic gates. The AND gate, represented by andGate, takes inputs a and b, and its output is directed to the intermediate signal x. Similarly, the NOT gate (notGate) processes input b, generating an output connected to the intermediate signal y. The OR gate (orGate) combines the outputs from x and y, ultimately producing the desired result in the output signal c.

Additionally, the code defines separate templates for the AND, NOT, and OR gates, encapsulating their respective logical operations. Finally, the instantiation of the Multiplier2 template is denoted as main, bringing together all the defined components and logic into a cohesive circuit.

Generates calldata for verification.
Calls verifyProof() on the verifier contract with calldata for proof verification.

## Circuit Structure 

```
├── multiplier
│   ├── circuit.circom
│   ├── input.json
│   └── out
│       ├── circuit.wasm
│       ├── multiplier.r1cs
│       ├── multiplier.vkey
│       └── multiplier.zkey
├── new-circuit
└── powersOfTau28_hez_final_12.ptau
```
Each new circuit lives in it's own directory. At the top level of each circuit directory lives the circom circuit and input to the circuit. The out directory will be autogenerated and store the compiled outputs, keys, and proofs. The Powers of Tau file comes from the Polygon Hermez ceremony, which saves time by not needing a new ceremony.
