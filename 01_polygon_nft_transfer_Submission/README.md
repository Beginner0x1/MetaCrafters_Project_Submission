## Polygon to Ethereum Using FxPortal

In this initiative, images generated by midjourney AI serve as the foundation for creating a collection of 5 unique NFTs. A Goerli Ethereum Testnet ERC721A contract is established, and the NFTs are stored on IPFS via pinata.cloud. The contract encompasses features such as minting, transferring, and mapping of the NFTs.

**Foundation:** Images generated by midjourney AI form the basis for a collection of 5 unique NFTs.
**Contract:** A Goerli Ethereum Testnet ERC721A contract is established with features for minting, transferring, and mapping NFTs.
**Storage:** NFTs are stored on IPFS via Pinata Cloud, leveraging its decentralized cloud storage using IPFS.

## Important Component 

**Pinata Cloud**: is a decentralized cloud storage platform that utilizes the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to store and distribute data. IPFS is a distributed file system that is resistant to censorship and tampering, making it an ideal platform for storing NFT metadata.

**Fxportal Bridge**: Fxportal is a Bridge that helps us to transfer assets between different blockchains, so Fxportal is the newest method of transferring assets between Polygon and Ethereum. FxPortal allows bridging for any ERC standard token without the need for mapping prior. The FxPortal contracts are flexible and allow for custom implementation of bridges using the Fx Base contracts.

**ERC271-A**: ERC-721A is a gas-efficient version of the original ERC-721 token. This token standard optimizes the ERC-721 standard by drastically lowering the fees for batch mints, where multiple tokens are minted in one transaction.

## Ethereum to Polygon Theory

- Deploy your own ERC20 token on the root chain. You will need this address later.
- Approve the tokens for transfer by calling the approve() function of the root token with the address of the root tunnel and the amount as the arguments.
- Proceed to call deposit() with the address of the receiver and amount on the root chain to receive the equivalent child token on the child chain. This will also map the token automatically. Alternatively, you can call mapToken() first before depositing.
- After mapping, you should now be able to execute cross-chain transfers using the deposit and withdraw functions of the tunnel.

## Steps To Produce 

- Configure your wallet for Ethereum testnet or polygon Mumbai, and configure .env file
- Adjust the Hardhat network settings in hardhat.config.js.
- Execute the deployment script using the command: ```npx hardhat run scripts/Deployed.js --network goerli.```
- Customize the Minted.js script with the required information By Adding Deployed Contract Address.
- Run the Minted.js script with the command: ```npx hardhat run scripts//NFTminted.js.js --network goerli.```
- Establish the FxPortal Bridge for transferring from Ethereum to Polygon.
- Update the Deposited.js script with the necessary details.
- Execute the Deposited.js script using the command: ```npx hardhat run scripts/Transfer&Deposit.js --network goerli.```

## Advantages 
```
Decentralized Storage: Utilizes Pinata Cloud with IPFS for secure and censorship-resistant NFT metadata storage.
Gas-Efficient Standard: ERC721-A optimizes gas usage, particularly beneficial for batch minting with lower transaction costs.
Cross-Chain Asset Transfer: FxPortal Bridge enables seamless and efficient asset transfers between Polygon and Ethereum without the need for prior mapping.
Customizable Bridge Implementation: FxPortal contracts allow custom implementations using Fx Base contracts, providing flexibility for project requirements.
Security and Immutability: ERC721A contract deployment on the Ethereum Testnet leverages the network's security features and immutability.
